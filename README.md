# TropicalWeather
For the TropicalWeather subreddit.

stylesheet_6-17-17.css is the copy before I got my hands on it. All the customization addons are uncompressed.

stylesheet_precomp_6-18-17.css is the current stylesheet, pre-compression. (Includes #yellow-text and the fixed text color/link stuff).

stylesheet_6-17-18.css is the current stylesheet, with compression.

Ideally, future changes should be made using stylesheet_precomp_6-18-17.css as a base, then compressing it for integration into the subreddit.
